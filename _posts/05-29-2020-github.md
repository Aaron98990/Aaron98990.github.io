Printers, watches, microwaves, security systems, lights, televisions, music players, car keys, thermostats, and so much more are being connected wirelessly everyday.

Our HP printer orders more ink when low through the internet, but [won't print](https://www.howtogeek.com/403346/hps-ink-subscription-has-drm-that-disables-your-printer-cartridges/) using the speecial ink cartridges when the monthly payment is not in. (Not the Owner)

Rechargeable watches have become trendy, but you have to charge it every night. (Not Realiable)

The Roku televisions have nice services, but it is [showing us ads](https://gizmodo.com/your-roku-is-an-ad-factory-1838843249) on the television settings interface. (Not in Control)

The point I am trying to make is that it may seem like a convience now but in the future when everything is online you will not own a single thing. 

Think car (20 year max lifespan) vs iPhone (5 year max lifespan).

You bought your car but without yearly software upgrades your car will stall. Oh wait, farmers already deal with [this](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/new-high-tech-farm-equipment-nightmare-farmers/).

The key is on your phone and the government can shut down that key if they want to apprehend you.

Just because you can does not mean you should.
