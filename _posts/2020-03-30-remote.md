Schools have closed down due to coronavirus epidemic. 

Motivation, productivity, and socialization has dwindled. The news is nearly 24/7 coronavirus. 

When I was in university, I did all of my work in the library or other academic facilities. I never did any work in my dorm room. If I am near my bed, I will go to sleep earlier than expected. I am only three feet away from my bed in my dorm room. 

The importance of what day or time it is has dwindled. Deadlines seem blurred as I could do work anytime I want. 

## Working from home
It is so easy to lay on the couch or bed, relax, then fall asleep. So, I did some research on best practices of working from home:

1. Set a work, non-work, and sleep schedule and stick to it
2. Do menial tasks (e.g brushing teeth, changing, making bed, washing dishes, cleaning)
3. Just start. Just do it. Start small, think big.
4. Make plans for your after-work hours, if possible.
5. Set your own deadlines. Don't let others do it for you.
6. Don't work on the bed, couch, or near a tv and avoid other distractions.
7. Don't use working from home as an excuse to be less productive
8. Take a walk, bike, **rollerskate** or at least go outside
9. Be proactive, not reactive.
10. Be deliberate in communication to instructors, family, friends, and teammates
11. **New:** Wear your socks and tennis/work shoes inside.

## Productivity 
I also did some research on goal setting, productivity, and mindset:

11. Focus on methods, not goals
12. Don't depend on temporary bursts of motivation and inspiration
13. Consistency show up. No excuses.
14. Avoid multi-tasking (e.g entertainment and education)
15. Focus on quality over quantity (e.g. 4 focused hrs vs 8 distracted hrs)
16. Learn from failures.
17. Divide each activity into smaller tasks
18. Eliminate distractions including emails, texts, social media
19. Outline desired outcomes then set tasks to achieve those outcomes
20. Do the most difficult things first.

So, you must force yourself or team to move in the desired direction aka get started.

There may be some contradictions, but I believe these are some useful observations and suggestions.
