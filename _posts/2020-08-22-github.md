I am not an AI expert but GPT-3 was exposed to more data and therefore perfmorms marginally better than previous iterations.

Plain and simple it is not really that amazing. It is an offline Google Search, if anything.

It would be interesting if GTP-3 performed better with less data.

But, remember that an "AI" does not need to perform at 100% to have significant effects.
