## Human Behavior
Here are some fancy observations on human behavior I gathered from the internet.

### Parkinson's Law:
> Work expands to fill the time alloted to it. 

When a deadline is near, people do more work in 12 hours then in the past 12 days. Close to a deadline we are forced to remained focused.

### Hofstadter's Law:
> It always take longer than expected, even taking into account Hofstadter's law.

### Pareto's Law:
> 80% of our results are the result of 20% of our efforts.

### Illich's Law:
> Productivity will decrease. 

So, take breaks and switch tasks.

### Carlson's Law:
> Work carried out continuously compared to in stages takes less time and energy.

### Murphy's Law:
> Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.

### Fraisse's Law:
> An hour is not always equal an hour. 

Pleasant tasks go by quicker while unpleasant tasks go by slower. Switching between the two may help.

### Laborit's Law (Law of Least Effort)
> We do what we like. 

### Newton's Motion Law
> One is at rest, unless some force acts on it.
