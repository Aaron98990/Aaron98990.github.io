"I have nothing to hide, because I am not doing naything wrong."

It even has its own [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument).

I have never felt this quote as true. With the age of technology, we are being monitored but even before we were being monitored it was almost impossible to keep a secret.

For example, the reality television show [Big Brother](https://csb.com/bigbrother) puts contestants in locked house together for about 90 days. I always find it really funny that when someone shares a secret, it becomes common knowledge  in the house in less than a day.

Now, we post everything publicly and people like me with unique names are stuck with their Google Search Results that easily identify me. Compare that to a Brad Williams which is a common name.

So, this is how I believe the quote should be read.

"I have nothing to hide because there is nothing I can hide."
