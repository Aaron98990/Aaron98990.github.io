"I have nothing to hide, because I am not doing nothing wrong."

It even has its own [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument).

I have never felt this quote as true. In the age of technology, we are being monitored. But, even before the age of laptops and mobile phones it was almost impossible to keep a secret.

For example, the 20-year reality television show [Big Brother](https://csb.com/bigbrother) puts contestants in a locked house together for about 90 days. When someone shares a secret, it becomes common knowledge in the house in less than a day.

Now, we post everything publicly and people like me with unique names are stuck with Google Search Results that share personally identifable information. Compare that to a Brad Williams which is a common name.

So, this is how I believe the quote should be read.

"I have nothing to hide because there is nothing I can hide."
