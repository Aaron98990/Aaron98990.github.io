title: "Scala 3.0 vs Python 3.0"
published: true

Scala 2 and Scala 3 are pretty similar other than some mini details.

Macros - There is going to be a different system and therefore needs to be re-written. The newer system is much cleaner.

This Qualifier - The private[this] and protected[this] access modifiers are deprecated and will be phased out. Private members are only accessed from this.

Do-While - Do <body> while <cond> is no longer being supported. It is being dropped because of how rare it is used.

Here are all the dropped features:
DelayedInit
Macros
Existential Types
Type Projection
Do-While
Procedure Syntax
Package Objects
Early Initializers
Class Shadowing
Limit 22
XML literals
Symbol Literals
Auto-Application
Weak Conformance
Nonlocal Returns
[this] Qualifier

The transition from Scala 2 to Scala 3 should be smoother than Python. Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.0 will share the same binary jar and therefore less likely to break.
