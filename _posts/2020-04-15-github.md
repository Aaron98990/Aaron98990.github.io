Github is very intimidating. It's not just you. That's why I created a simple tutorial  of the most used commands. Please refer to [GitHub 102](../../22/github) if you are familiar with Git.

Version control is like your browser history but with code or files. Git helps to track errors down by bisecting, keeps a log of changes, allows collaboration by pulling and pushing, and makes adding new features easy by branching from the source code. There are different flavors of version control, but Git is the most popular. 

## Working with the terminal
Terminals open up programs. Linux and Windows uses different programs. Here are some helpful tutorials:

Everything controlled on the terminal, can be controlled graphically (e.g. File Explorer). In the terminal, always remember the directory you are in. In summary, the most useful commands are:
```console
ls
cd
```

## Download Git
Depending on your operating system and computer specification different methods work better than others.

## Working with Vim
Vim is a popular and minimalist text editor that usually comes pre-installed on your computer. Some git commands will open the editor automatically. Since, some commands are not intuitive a quit tutorial is included here.

Open vim on your editor:
```console
vim abc.txt
```

Generally, pressing letters will not type anything out. Enter insert mode to start typing:
```console
i
```

After typing some things, quit insert mode by pressing the ESC button. To save your changes and quit the text:
```console
:wq
```console

## Exploring Github
Github contains a lot of open-source software. This means that anyone can view, modify, and improve projects if they follow the license. Also, a lot of features are free. Search github for some cool projects.

Here are the list of my favorite Github projects:
1. [Free Code Camp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)
2. [YouTube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)

I hope this tutorial made Github less intimidating.
