Schools have closed down due to cornoavirus epidemic. 

Motivation, productivity, and socialization has dwindled. The news is nearly 24/7 coronavirus. 

When I was in university, I did all of my work in the library or other academic facilities. I never did any work in my dorm room. If I am near my bed, I will go to sleep earlier than expected. I am only three feet away from my bed in my dorm room. 

The importance of what day or time it is has dwindled. Deadlines seem blurred as I could do work anytime I want. 

I face the same problem at home. It is so easy to lay on the couch or bed, relax, then fall asleep. So, I did some research on best practices of working and living from home:

1. Set a work and sleep schedule and stick to it
2. Do Menial tasks (e.g brushing teeth, changing, making bed, washing dishes, cleaning)
3. Just start. Just do it. Start small, think big.
4. Make plans for your after-work hours
5. Set your own deadlines. Don't let others do it for you.
6. Don't work on the bed, couch, or near a tv and avoid other distractions.
7. Don't use working from home as an excuse to be less productive
8. Take a walk, bike, or go outside
9. Be proactice, not reactive.
10. Be delibrate in communication to professors, family, friends, groupmates


I also did some research on goal setting, productivity, and mindset:

11. Focus on methods, not goals
12. Don't depend on temporary bursts of motivation and inspiration
13. Consistency show up. No excuses.
14. Avoid multi-tasking (e.g entertainment and education)
15. Focus on quality over quantity (e.g. 4 focused hrs vs 8 distracted hrs)
16. Learn from failures.
17. Divide each activity into smaller tasks
18. Eliminate distractions including emails, texts, social media
19. Outline desired outcomes then set tasks to achieve those outcomes
20. Do the most difficult things first.

Lastly, here are some fancy observations on human behavior:

Parkinson's Law:
Work exapnds to fill the time alloted to it. When a deadline is near, people do more work in 12 hours then in the past 12 days. Close to a deadline we are forced to remained focused.

Hofstadter's Law:
It always take longer than expected, wven taking into account Hofstadter's law.

Pareto's Law:
80% of our results are the result of 20% of our efforts.

Illich's Law:
Productivty will decrease. So, take breaks and switch taks.

Carlson's Law:
Work carried out continiously compared to in stages takes less time and energy.

Murphy's Law:
Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.

Frasisse's Law:
An hour is not always equal an hour. Pleasent tasks go by quicker while unpleasant tasks go by slower. Switching between the two may help.

Laborit's Law (Law of Least Effort):
We do the easiest work first. So, start the day with complex tasks.

Newton's Motion Law:
One is at rest, unless some force acts on it. So, you must force yourself or team to move in the desired direction aka get started.

Some points may be contradictory to other, but I think it may be useful.
