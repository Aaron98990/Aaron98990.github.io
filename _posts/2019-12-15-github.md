So, winter break porudctivity is either a hit or mess. So, I compiled some small goals to reflect on.

## Productivity 
I also did some research on goal setting, productivity, and mindset:

11. Focus on methods, not goals
12. Don't depend on temporary bursts of motivation and inspiration
13. Consistency show up. No excuses.
14. Avoid multi-tasking (e.g entertainment and education)
15. Focus on quality over quantity (e.g. 4 focused hrs vs 8 distracted hrs)
16. Learn from failures.
17. Divide each activity into smaller tasks
18. Eliminate distractions including emails, texts, social media
19. Outline desired outcomes then set tasks to achieve those outcomes
20. Do the most difficult things first.

So, you must force yourself or team to move in the desired direction aka get started.

There may be some contradictions, but I believe these are some useful observations and suggestions.
